    </div>

            <!-- Always visible preview -->
            <p>
                I was born and raised in one of the most historically rich cities in the world, Isfahan,
                in the heart of Iran. From a very young age, around six or seven, I fell in love with the
                magic of the stars in the night sky, much like many other children.
            </p>

                    What began as childhood curiosity, however, gradually developed into a clear and
                    lasting ambition. I pursued this dream with patience and determination, completing
                    high school in mathematics and physics with a final grade of XX, ranking among the
                    top students of my year.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I went on to earn my Bachelor’s degree in Physics at the University of Isfahan between
                    2010 and 2014. After graduating in my hometown, I felt ready to embrace a new challenge
                    and slightly redirect my academic path.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I therefore took a one-year gap to prepare for the national entrance examination for a
                    Master’s program in Nanotechnology. The year 2015 proved to be a pivotal period in both
                    my personal and academic development, as I was accepted into Tarbiat Modares University
                    in Tehran.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In 2018, I was accepted into a PhD program at the Max Planck Institute for the Structure
                    and Dynamics of Matter. Due to visa constraints, my move to Germany was delayed until
                    November 2019, but I ultimately joined the research group led by <a href="https://qcmd.mpsd.mpg.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                    Andrea Cavalleri
                    </a> where I became deeply immersed in the fields of ultrafast lasers and superconductivity.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In May 2025, I successfully defended my PhD thesis with the highest possible grade (1.0).
                    I subsequently continued in the same group as a postdoctoral researcher until September
                    2025. At that point, I recognized that it was time to move forward, explore new
                    directions, and seek the next stage of my professional journey.
