            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p>
                I was born and raised in one of the most historical cities in the world, Isfahan, in the heart of Iran. As a
                young kid and from the age of 6~7 I fell in love with the magic of the stars in the sky! perhaps like many
                other kids...this, however, was just a the start. I continued patiently to work towards my dream. I finished the 
                high school in Math & Physcis subject with final grade of XX, as one of the top sudents in the year group. After finishing
                my Bachelor in Physics in the University of Isfahan (2010 - 2014) in my hometown, I finally felt ready to take on a new challenge and
                change my path slightly. I then took a year gap to prepare for entrance exam for the master in Nanotechnology. The year 2015 was 
                of a great importance in my personal and academic development, where I was accepted to one of the top university in Tehran, 
                Tarbiate Modares University, to continue my studies in a big city of Tehran. I then finished my master thesis with a high grade   PhD graduate in experimental physics, I bring a wealth of hands-on experience
                in optics, laser, cryogenics, and sample preparation, as well as strong analytical
                expertise in data analysis, simulation, and modelling. I have proven my ability to
                lead complex projects, exercising strong and effective communication across diverse
                teams. For the next step in my career, I am seeking a position where I can apply my
                expertise while continuing to expand my professional capabilities.
